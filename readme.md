aiformat is a simple tool you can use from the command line. It helps you select files and folders and change them into a format that AI assistants like Claude can understand.

This way, you can share code snippets and project structures faster and easier directly from the console, without having to copy and paste them manually.

This cli tool is built using [Ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink).

## Install

To install aiformat, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. Then, run the following command:

```bash
npm install --global aiformat
```

## Usage

To use aiformat, navigate to the directory containing the files and folders you want to share with Claude. Then, run the following command:

```bash
aiformat
```

The CLI will display a list of files and folders in the current directory. You can navigate through the list using the up and down arrow keys. To select or deselect an item, use the left or right arrow keys.

You can also filter the list by typing a search query. The list will update in real-time as you type.

Once you have selected the desired files and folders, press Enter. The CLI will format the selected items into a structure that Claude can understand and automatically copy the output to your clipboard.

## Example

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
aiformat
```

Navigate through the list, select the desired files and folders, and press Enter. The formatted output will be copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted into your conversation with your AI assistant.

The output is optimized for usage with Claude, by wrapping files with XML tags.
